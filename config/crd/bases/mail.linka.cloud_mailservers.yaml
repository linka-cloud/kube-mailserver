                                Nodes that have a label with this key and identical
                                values are considered to be in the same topology.
                                We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try
                                to put balanced number of pods into each bucket. We
                                define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
                                Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose
                                nodes meet the requirements of nodeAffinityPolicy
                                and nodeTaintsPolicy. e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname",
                                each Node is a domain of that topology. And, if TopologyKey
                                is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain
                                of that topology. It's a required field.

                                to schedule the pod in any location, but giving higher
                                precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
                                skew. A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for
                                an incoming pod if and only if every possible node
                                assignment for that pod would violate "MaxSkew" on
                                some topology. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew
                                is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector
                                spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P P
                                |   P   |   P   | If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule,
                                incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone2(zone3)
                                to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3)
                                satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster
                                can still be imbalanced, but scheduler won''t make
                                it *more* imbalanced. It''s a required field.'

                        taints when calculating pod topology spread skew. Options
                        are: - Honor: nodes without taints, along with tainted nodes
                        for which the incoming pod has a toleration, are included.
                        - Ignore: node taints are ignored. All nodes are included.
                        \n If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the

                      description: TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that
                        have a label with this key and identical values are considered
                        to be in the same topology. We consider each <key, value>
                        as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number of pods into
                        each bucket. We define a domain as a particular instance of
                        a topology. Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain
                        whose nodes meet the requirements of nodeAffinityPolicy and
                        nodeTaintsPolicy. e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname",
                        each Node is a domain of that topology. And, if TopologyKey
                        is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain of
                        that topology. It's a required field.

                        pod if it doesn''t satisfy the spread constraint. - DoNotSchedule
                        (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it. - ScheduleAnyway
                        tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location, but
                        giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce
                        the skew. A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an
                        incoming pod if and only if every possible node assignment
                        for that pod would violate "MaxSkew" on some topology. For
                        example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods
                        with the same labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2
                        | zone3 | | P P P |   P   |   P   | If WhenUnsatisfiable is
                        set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled to
                        zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on
                        zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster
                        can still be imbalanced, but scheduler won''t make it *more*
                        imbalanced. It''s a required field.'
